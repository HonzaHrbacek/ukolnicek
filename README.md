Ukolnicek/Task tracker 

A web application that allows you to track short tasks and notes. These are stored in localStorage, so they remain available to users even after closing the browser.

In creating this project, I used the ReactJS library, which is an amazing tool for creating UI interfaces. In practice, I learned to build a web application using functional components and use the so-called props or useState and useEffect hooks, which allow you to change the UI according to the current state of the web application.

Based on an app made by Brad Traversy.
